# About

Redonda is a research project funded by the European [CHIST-ERA](https://www.chistera.eu/) initiative.
It involves several universities and research institutions from France, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom (see the [Partners](partners.html) page for details).

# Objectives

Redonda investigates the construction of next-generation replication protocols for blockchain.
For this, the project taps into recent advances in networking, secure computing, and distributed systems.
This includes technologies such as RDMA and TEE, recent principles, e.g., leaderless and DAG-based state-machine replication, and the correct-by-design composition of building blocks for consensus.
