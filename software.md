### Mangosteen

Mangosteen is an advanced programming framework designed to enhance linearizable in-memory applications by providing fast and transparent durability using non-volatile memory (NVM). 
A paper desscribing Mangosteen was [presented](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc24/presentation/egorov) at USENIX ATC in 2024.
The code can be find online [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11390432).

### Revoke

Revoke is a new protocol that helps to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. 
A prototype of the Revoke protocol is available [online](https://github.com/s3lab-rhul/revoke).
Revoke is described in a [paper](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/publications/revoke-mitigating-ransomware-attacks-against-ethereum-validators) that appear at ESORICS '24.

### PoCs

Below, we list some preliminaries designs and on-going works:

* Parallel consensus execution in CometBFT ([url](https://github.com/minhtung0404/cometbft/tree/epoch))

* A stake-based mempool for CometBFT ([url](https://github.com/POLAARK/cometbft))
